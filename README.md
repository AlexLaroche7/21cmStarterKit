Hi friends! 

The purpose of this repo is for us to have a place where we can put instructive resources. Hopefully, this way whenever someone is starting to delve into a new challenge (Compute Canada, parallel programming, bash scripts, etc) they have many helpful documents available! 

I've made a first example of the sort of things we might want to put on here. The subdirectory bash_scripts has a markdown file where I've written a little crash course on bash scripting, and have included a script that people can run that illustrates some concepts.
